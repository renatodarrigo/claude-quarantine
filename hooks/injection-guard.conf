# claude-quarantine — Configuration
# See: https://github.com/renatodarrigo/claude-quarantine

# --- Layer Toggles ---
ENABLE_LAYER1=true          # Pattern scanner (fast, ~50-200ms)
ENABLE_LAYER2=false         # LLM analysis (slow, ~2-5s) — enable for high-risk sessions
ENABLE_LAYER3=true          # MCP proxy (requires proxy tools, ~100-500ms on top of fetch)

# --- Layer 2 Settings ---
# Requires `claude` CLI (ships with Claude Code).
# Only runs when Layer 1 didn't already find HIGH severity.
# Gracefully degrades if claude CLI is missing or times out.
# Adds ~2-5s latency per tool call when enabled.
LAYER2_MAX_CHARS=10000      # Max content length sent to LLM analysis (truncated if larger)

# --- Threat Response ---
# What to do on HIGH threat: "block" (exit 2, halts Claude) or "warn" (systemMessage only)
HIGH_THREAT_ACTION=block

# --- Logging ---
LOG_FILE=~/.claude/hooks/injection-guard.log
LOG_THRESHOLD=MED           # Minimum level to log: LOW, MED, HIGH
